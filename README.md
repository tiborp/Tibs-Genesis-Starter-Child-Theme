=== Tibs Genesis Starter Child Theme ===

This is my version of a Genesis Starter Child Theme. It uses a theme setup function for all the stuff I usually add and remove when starting a new Genesis Child Theme, using Genesis 2.x.x

Consider it a work in progress; feel free to fork, edit, comment etc.

Thanks to Bill Erickson and Matt Banks for showing me the way.

Note that you'll need to have the [http://studiopress.com](Genesis Theme Framework) installed to use this theme.
